# Traffic-Sign-Classification
A deep-learning traffic sign recognition project, using a convolutional neural network model, with PyTorch over the [GTSRB - German Traffic Sign](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign?resource=download). In very early development.

There are three main components planned for this project:

1) Traffic Sign Classification
Develop a model that, given any RGB image of a traffic sign, can classify it into 1 of 43 possible classes.

2) Traffic Sign Detection
Develop another model that, given an image, detects the presence of a traffic sign and give its pixel coordinates, allowing for posterior classification.

3) Web-app
Deploy a web-app, using Flask or Django, that allows the user to upload an image and run the models.
